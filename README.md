# Key Driver Reports

## Moffitt Cancer Center - Patient Experience Department

### Overview

This is the service line-level version of the key driver reports.

Press Ganey (PG) provides these reports on an annual basis.

This code allows the reports to be generated at will.

The reports are based on 

(1) the correlation between the institutional measure, Likelihood to Recommend the Facility (LTR), and the other survey questions; 
(2) the top box ratio, or likelihood of receiving LTR top box when receiving the top box for other survey questions; and 
(3) external rankings from PG database.

There are three sources of data: individual-level survey results (source: Power BI semantic model), Survey Questions, and External Rankings (source: PG Fusion)
